in north virginia (eg: 10.0.0.0/16)

step1:

create vpc
create subnet
cretae igw
rename route table
In route table add route to its igw 0.0.0.0 ----- igw
ensure the rt table is associated with default rt table


step2 
  
create sg group ---inbound -ssh-22-0.0.0.0 ---outbound ---LL
LAUNCH VPC WITH PUBLIC IP
ASSOC SG WITH EC2

step3
  
create tg---asn-4200000000 check info
create tg attachment and add vpc as attachment

  only in one vpc create tgw attach and add as peering and related info
  
obsrve (tgw rt tables) , routes are propogated


step 4
  
NV sg modify inbound telenet cusotm tcp port 23 ------ opp vpc cidr (eg 198.0..0.0/16)

step5
  
nv - modify vpc route table
CIDR of opp vpc to transit gateway-----(198.0.0.0/16 ----- transit gateway)
same viceversa in other region......................

for both
  create static route under tgw attachment(nc)
    under routes section
          create static route
  opp vpc cidr (nv) -------- attach as peering

  same vice versa in NV by adding nc cidr as peering
